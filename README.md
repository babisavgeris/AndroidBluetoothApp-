# AndroidBluetoothApp-

This is an android application, which will use Bluetooth technology to locate the nearest nearby devices, in order to inform and notify the user whether he is in a crowded place. The application will also communicate with a server, which is developed using Spring Boot. The data from the application will be sent to the web server, where they will be stored in a database and then they will be used to export statistics such as in which countries the highest overcrowding is observed, in which cities, days etc.
